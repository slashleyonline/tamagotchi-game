// CREATIVE TILT:
//      I decided that I didn't want to make a "game", and focused more on making something akin to a desktop pet. I enjoyed learning how to make a 
// game that was dependent on real-world time, and I had fun doing research on Tamagotchi, doing my best to recreate their style. I also spent 
// an extensive amount of time learning how to take 3D models, and turn them into spritesheets. Once I learned the workflow it actually saved me 
// a decent amount of time in the long run. 

// I'm really proud of the animation I did at the beginning, with the tamagotchi flying out of the box. It took some clever layer manipulation 
// and use of the timers to accomplish.
